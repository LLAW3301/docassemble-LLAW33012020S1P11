MyDocs is an application created for Hutt St Centre for the purpose of assisting people to locate identity documentation ('ID'). Currently, there is no single website or resource which simply explains where and how to obtain essential self-identification documents. Users of MyDocs can use the application to select the ID that they already have and the ID that they are seeking to obtain. The application will use this data to provide information which will assist the user in their ID application process. Our ultimate goal for creating MyDocs is to create an empowering tool which provides people experiencing disadvantage, who may seek Hutt St Centre's services, with the opportunity to feel a sense of connection and belonging.
