## Statutory Declaration, primary and secondary document information. Examples and definitions provided.
template: example_documents
content: |
  ### Primary Documents
  A **primary document** is an identity document that must include your full name and date of birth. It may also include a combination of your photograph, address, place of birth, or signature. 
  
  Examples of **primary documents** are:
  
  %for a_pd in required_documents:
  %if required_documents[a_pd]['id_type'] == 'primary':
  %if a_pd not in has_primary_documents_list:
  - ${required_documents[a_pd]['Name']}
  %endif
  %endif
  %endfor 
  
  ### What if I do not have any Primary Documents?
  A **statutory declaration** form can be filled out if you **do not have any  primary documents.** You can use this form as a primary document. It is a written statement that you sign and declare to be true in front of an authorised witness, such as a **Justice of the Peace.**
  
  You will only be required to submit one statutory declaration to declare that you do not have any form of ID.
  
  If you require assistance, a staff member of Hutt Street Centre may be able to help you fill out and submit your statutory declaration form. 
  
  To find where you can access a Justice of the Peace in South Australia, click [here](https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/rights-and-law/rights-and-responsibilities/justices-of-the-peace/find-a-jp)
  
  You can fill out a statutory declaration [here](https://www.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/11432/MR28.pdf)  
  
  ### Secondary Documents
  A **secondary document** is a document that provides some personal information. This could include a combination of your photograph, full name, address, date of birth, or signature.
  
  Examples of **secondary documents** you can use may be:
  
    * A current entitlement card issued by a Commonwealth Government Department (e.g. a Medicare card, Centrelink Basics Card);
    * A current credit card or ATM card from a financial institution (e.g. Commonwealth Bank, BankSA etc.);
    * Telephone, gas or electricity account not more than six months old;    
    * Water or local rates notice or land valuation notice not more than two years old;
    * Evidence of electoral enrolment not more than two years old;    
    * Centrelink Health Care Card;   
    * Centrelink Commonwealth Seniors Health Card; and
    * Department of Veteran Affairs pensioner concession card
